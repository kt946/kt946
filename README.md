# Hello World! 👋 I’m Kyle! Nice to meet you! 😉

I'm a full stack web developer with a B.A. in Psychology from Rutgers University and a passion for technology, creativity, and learning. Currently, I'm pursuing a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I'm experienced in both front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. As a versatile quick learner and problem-solver, I'm able to collaborate with teams in fast-paced settings to design innovative projects that exceed expectations. Previously as part of a team, I've applied my expertise in web development to create a website that allows users to search for movies and TV shows, save them to a personal watchlist, and post comments. I'm eager to demonstrate my newly acquired skills and build innovative applications that help me grow as a developer and provide users with immersive web experiences.

Check out my works and contact information. I’m happy to connect with you!
